## Verifying

When you have JDK configured,
you can execute command `javac --version` in your terminal,
and you can see the version of the compiler like this below:

## Meet JShell

Before we write code with a file, we prefer to use a _REPL_ (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) environment to easily run our code.

Open JShell with `jshell`, and you can see the information:

Now it's our time!

## Printing

You can print something with `System.out.println`.
This is a _method_ that prints _objects_ to the terminal.

To call a method, please add parentheses after the method name.
Press <shortcut>Tab</shortcut> to auto-complete the context.

You can see an empty line printed after you called this method.
